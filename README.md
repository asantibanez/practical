Practical
=========

A practical DynamoDB Active Record library.

Practical was built to simplify interactions with Amazon's DynamoDB. This NoSQL 
database is really powerful but the documentation is not easily read or understood. 
Practical takes away the burden allowing an accessing DynamoDB records in an Active 
Record fashion. 

Practical is heavily influenced by Laravel's Eloquent ORM (http://laravel.com) because 
of its fluent and expressive syntax when working with databases. Practical tries to 
emulate some of its features by allowing direct mapping to DynamoDB tables by configuring 
a Javascript class with your model's definition.
